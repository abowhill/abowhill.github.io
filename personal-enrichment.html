              <p>What are you left with after a college degree in CS? Can you legitimately
decalare personal enrichment when all else fails, like Liberal Arts grads?
Probably, if you can manage to cast-aside your real-life industry experience.</p>
<p>90% of real-world SW development only has meaning when applied to
corporate ventures. There is some, but not much practical standalone art
divorced permanently and entirely from commercial interests, and outside
the various research bubbles of academia. Most good open-source has
obvious commerical application.</p>
<p>Companies have a lot of real-world control and influence over the design
and perpituity of almost everything technological: hardware, OS, protocols,
applications, services, careers.</p>
<p>Conversely, only about 30% of what you learn at a university if you
major in CS is firmly applicable technical coursework. Generally, you will
have Liberal Arts, and a substantial dose of indirectly-applicable computer
industry related stuff, like testing, ethics, documentation, management,
software process, manufacturing, undelying science, etc.</p>
<p>When you get out of school, in reality, you directly apply only a fraction of
that 30% platform-independent knowledge. Math or spcialized algorithms may
only occasionally demand their use in your work. Mostly the application of
knowledge is oblique, unspecific to a single thing, but a sum of things you
learned, such as choosing approriate data structures, selecting
algorithms, your approach to design, methodology.</p>
<p>It also depends greatly on what kind of job(s) you get. Higher-level
work demands more platform-independent architecture knowledge to be applied.
Lower-level work (such as testing / support) requires little to none of
these, depending on how narrowly the job is defined. Narrowly-defined or
over-defined tech postions are not good places to practice the
"science" part of computer science, unless you breach the bounds of your
responsibilities, or bury your code out of sight.</p>
<p>Many jobs are like this. Siloed, over-defined, dedicated middle-tier or
low-tier tech positions that require a tenacious human to prop-up and maintain
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Over time, companies tend to accumulate the machinery of production and
organize labor under a kind of gravitational pull to integrate and silo
jobs around standing infrastructure. Most of the iceburg is underwater, and
strange mythical specialties are required to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>Higher-level, broadly-defined experiences are more difficult to explain
at inteviews, but are more effective at getting jobs, because you have talking
points about innovation and project creativity.</p>
<p>HR and hiring managers tend to harbor cookie-cutter notions about
job titles and their associated responsibilities. SDETS are supposed to
write test plans, right? Nope. Not necessarily. QA engineers mostly do
manual testing right? Nope. Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Even after an explanation, to the hiring process, my silo is not your silo.
But if your silo is narrower than mine, I will probably get hired by you,
because it's a step down from what I was just doing. Catch me while I fall
with your silo funnel.</p>
<p>Lower-level experiences are easier to explain, but can be more harshly
inconsistent in job title vs. real responsibilties. You may never
get the chance to design and construct anything permanent. In some cases,
you may not be allowed to, due to the unprivileged role you play. This
drastically reduces talking-points at future interviews.</p>
<p>At low-level experiences, you may have the title of Builder or QA engineer,
but you may never build or test software. You may just debug broken builds
or false-positive test results. There's an automated system for testing and
building. These jobs are, at their moment of highest merit, "fixer" rather
than "creator" jobs. You didn't create something great. You prevented
something bad from happening, if you are lucky.</p>
<p>You may do considerable amount of runtime tracking and reporting. You
may do a lot of machine setup. But no actual testing or building.
Machines do that. Your job is to figure out how the machines broke.
My silo may not even remotely resemble the label it was given.</p>
<p>It becomes harder to find work when you become too siloed. What you do for
money tends to determine in the minds of other people what you are considered
capable of doing for money.</p>
<p>No sense in trying to raise the bar yourself, because it's not
about what you did between jobs, it's always about what you did at
your most recent job. And this plots the curve of your career trajectory.</p>
<p>After some point, inference suggests how jobs devolve into experiences
so servile and meaningless that even you, with your lethal combination of
tenacity and low self-esteem cannot stand to perform them anymore.</p>
<p>You disintegrate into a false role of helper to an SDET or tester or builder,
like the old actor who stops acting to become the backstage doorman.</p>
<p>These jobs become a source of professional self-harm. There is a threshold at
which you simply must draw a line in the sand that says "enough" and just pick
up something new. Anything.</p>
<p>So, yes. Personal Enrichment. College was good. And it made me a
better-informed technologist. The career fell short, but for reasons having
little to do with school.</p>
<p>APIs are like engineered fishing holes. You either design one to be fished by a user for helper functions, or you make the user stock it with their own data to get custom behavior. </p>
<p>This is related to the size of facilities the library supplies. <em>Rich APIs</em> and <em>Convenience Libraries</em> have a tendency to be broad (many functions) and shallow (small objects). Narrow and deep functionality can sometimes be found with <em>Minimal APIs</em>.</p>
<p>Rich APIs are desirable becuase they offer a maximal amount of public functions from which to choose and minimal delegation control to a library. The downside is you use only 1% of what is in the library, but include this fat at run-time. Using rich APIs not only creates fat binaries (an actual problem nowadays) but also prevents you from writing only small amounts of comparatively simple code that you use often.</p>
<p>Thin APIs are desirable because they minimize the number of public functions and maximize delegation to a library. You're using a 99% of the code, but must live with the behavior of the library. This creates thin binaries, and can save you from writing large programs that you run only a few times. Those programs may not run exactly the way you want, but that is a problem with all libraries.</p>
<p>Which is more programmer-efficient?</p>
<p>An API user uses a library in the first place to minimize writing code. When you offer many small functions attached to manipulating a small object, you tend to defeat that purpose by increasing user dependency and offering only the illusion of delegating work. The user still ends-up writing code for large facilities.</p>
<p>In either case, the value of using libraries is measured by the amount of work saved in coding time. It's better to Code your own String class and use it a million times. It's less better to code your own XML parser that you use only once.</p>
<p>In designing a library, if you take the view that it serves a purpose by offering major facilities, and you recognize the user signs over control to the library to perform all functions related to those facilities, the concept of <em>less is more</em> (aka: minimal) becomes important.</p>
<p>Minimalism implies offering only a few public method calls - ideally not much outside of initialization, shutdown and configuration. However, if an API is well-designed, it also means that user is given control by <em>data-oriented configuration</em>.</p>
<p>Data-oriented configuration comes in the form of compile-time configuration "knobs" representing data inputs that can be set by the API user to customize special behavior of the facility offered. Designing an API in this way means writing quite a bit of support code, perhaps doubling the amount of original code to get the thing functional in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, offering an engineered system of control to users is very different than exposing a simple bucket of loosely-related helper functions centered on a frequently used, easily-programmed things. To design a system, you're not offering a <em>rich API</em> or <em>convenience library</em> but more like a full-fledged, programmable application module.</p>
<p>In libraries like these, the user hands control over to your code to perform a major application function they would rather not write. Simplified data input of configuration rather than a rich functional interface represents a higher-level of design consideration.</p>
<p>Your library offers a limited set of knobs. The user sets them according to preference. Set and forget.</p>
