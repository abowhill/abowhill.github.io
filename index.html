    <span class="postDetails clearfix"><time datetime="11-2013" class="date details">Nov 22 2013</time></span>
    <p>I remember one of my CS profs in college telling the class that when we graduate, we will come out knowing <em>this much</em> (petite two-finger gesture here) about programming. Well, I don’t know about that, as programming in the real world is considerably further up the curve on mechanics, tools reliance, and development fads, but far behind the curve on applying theory and good engineering practice. But there you have it. The academic view on Bachelor’s degree candidates. There is some truth to the statement. </p>

    <p>Over the mast month or so I’ve been studying the <a href="http://www.scala=lang.org">Scala</a> programming language, and am about halfway through the book<a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed">Programming in Scala, Odersky, Spoon and Venners</a>. </p>

<p>My initial exposure to Scala was kind of double-edged. On one edge, attraction; the other, revulsion. All great technologies, works of art, areas of learning can have this duality. Obviously, these works initially attract me. From that set, many succeed in subsequently repelling me forever for one reason or another. Ruby succeeded in not repelling me forever. Only time will tell with Scala.</p>

    <p>My wife just recently got a new HP Chromebook, causing her to rapidly abandon her 3-year old Toshiba NB 205 netbook. This gave me a new computer to experiment on, and of course I installed FreeBSD.</p>

<p>This is a very low-powered machine, with a ton of case-edge built-in peripherals. It has 2G ram, and an internal disk upgraded to 230G. It originally came pre-packaged with Win7 “Starter” edition and a bunch of Toshiba bloatware, which makes it the perfect target for an OS nuke and wicked post-nuclear experimentation.</p>

    <p>On a Google Chromebook you can access a UNIX-like terminal window by typing CTRL-T from the Chrome browser. This feature makes a Chromebook much more viable to use for technical people.</p>

<p>Without it, you’d have to setup your own HTTP/SSL Tunneling/Comet server at home to even come close to embedding a terminal in a web browser (a complicated setup project I have done before). So hat’s off to whoever had the wherewithal to put that feature in. </p>

    <span class="postDetails clearfix"><time datetime="05-2013" class="date details">May 13 2013</time></span>
    <p>One of the more stifling features of object-oriented programming is trying to figure out what classes to design.</p>

<p>Unlike its venerated, comparatively simple tribal cousin, procedural programming, object-oriented programming requires you to invent abstractions in the form of classes that describe the problem domain, or selected parts of it - and package functions with data. The classes you design are blueprints from which objects are manufactured at runtime.</p>

    <p>I’ve been working out the design for a Ruby program that builds regular, plain old  jails over the past couple of days.</p>

<p>After identifying and reading-up on the problem domain, then writing a set of manual setup instructions for it (still underway[^1]), I felt I knew enough to begin design. The program I’m writing is kind of a warm-up to eventually writing a script that installs service jails, which is an advanced setup task.</p>

    <p>Sadly again, I find myself using the punishing /bin/sh to script tasks in FreeBSD. And again, I am reminded how painful and time-consuming it can be to do some of the simplest things.</p>

<p>One of the first things you should realize is that sh is not Bash. It is Bash featureless ancestor - a kind of pygmy caveman. It is smaller, faster, and somewhat harder to work with. It has nearly meaningless error-messages.</p>

<p>Using Wayne Seguin’s RVM (Ruby Version Manager) is definitely the best way to go for installing Ruby on most UNIX platforms. It allows any kind of Ruby to be installed, even multiple versions, and will keep everything in the home directory under .RVM, so no admin-level system installations are required. It is very well maintained, and considered the defacto standard for maintaining and updating Ruby installations. Visit <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a> for more information. After installation, use: rvm notes for up-to-date information about the installed framework.</p>

    <p>Ssh port forwarding leverages the idea that your secure identity - once established on a bunch of machines that are aware of each other – can give you kind of superman access abilities - to leap servers and firewalls with a single bound, assign services on one machine to exist on another, etc. Practically every barrier you would normally encounter on a network can be circumvented - be it hardware or software.</p>
